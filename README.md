# Car Dealership

## Description of the Project

- This is a simple Java console app that helps a car dealership keep track of its vehicle inventory. You can search for cars by things like price, make/model, year, color, mileage, or type. It also lets you list all cars, add new ones, or remove ones that are sold. The app loads the dealership info from a CSV file when it starts and saves any changes back to the file.
